# Finko online documentation

Finko is a software for Windows 10 (and above) to help you manage personal finance.

Finko is available in the Microsoft Store on Windows for free without any subscription.  
It was created to rekindle the passion for Microsoft Money in the early 2000s.

The product is currently in **Technical Preview**. You can use it regularly but be aware that there may be some glitches.   
Feel free to send error reports and ideas using the [https://github.com/sebbouez/Finko/issues](https://github.com/sebbouez/Finko/issues) link.

Hope you'll enjoy using Finko as much as we enjoyed creating it.
