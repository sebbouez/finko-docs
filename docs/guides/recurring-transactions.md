# Create and manage recurring transactions

Recurring transactions are transactions that occur regularly such as your salary, various subscriptions...
In Finko, recurring transactions can be set to:

* each week
* each month
* each trimester
* each quarter
* each half year
* each year

Setting recurring transactions help you see what's coming in the **Account Forecast**.

!!! note ""

    In the current version, recurring transactions are not automatically added to the account when time approaches.  
    You have to go to the **Transactions scheduler** then use the **Create transaction in target account** button.  
    This behavior will change in the coming releases.
